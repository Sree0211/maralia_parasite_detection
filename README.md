# Maralia Parasite Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection of malaria parasites in blood smear images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow. The goal is to perform binary image classification, distinguishing between images containing malaria parasites and those without.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images of blood smears, some with malaria parasites and some without. The dataset is taken from the Tensorflow page
Link - https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/malaria
The notebook provides instructions for loading and exploring the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include resizing images, normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These steps are essential for preparing the data for training a CNN model.

## CNN Model
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is designed to learn features from image data efficiently. The notebook provides details on the model architecture used for this specific project.

## Training
The CNN model is trained on the training set, and the training process is visualized using metrics such as loss and accuracy.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess its performance in detecting malaria parasites.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are encouraged! If you have ideas for improvements, want to experiment with different CNN architectures, or identify any issues, feel free to open issues and pull requests.
